## Customizing the template

- Placeholder texts are entered prefixed with @@ (ex: src/app/banner/banner.component.html, tittle text). Make sure to replace them with the proper application title
- Update package.json and set the proper project name
- Customize the banner css scripts, layout, logo, etc.
- Update both environment files (environments/environment.ts and environments/environment.prod.ts) and set MonitorUrl to the URL of a website monitoring the Fabric server used by the backend application
